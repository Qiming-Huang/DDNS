Receive the new IP of your server which changed from time to time

* the idea is showed as below:
	* your server visit a website which could show your current public IP address
	* compare with your recorded ip address
	* if it was same, pass. Otherwise, send a email to inform you
	* repeat the strps at a regular intervals
* future improvement
	* after I receive the new IP address, I have to go to the Domain name supplier like Alibaba Cloud Computing and change the domain name resolution manually. I want to make it automatically.
